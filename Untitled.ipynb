    "- **Concurrency**: broadly, the ability for multiple tasks to run in an overlapping manner\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: a subset of concurrency characterized by performing *multiple operations at the same time*\n",
    "- **Multiprocessing**: a form of parallelism achieved by spreading tasks across a processor's cores; good for tasks that are *CPU-bound*\n",
    "- **Threading**: a form of concurrency in which multiple threads take turns executing their tasks; good for tasks that are *IO-bound*\n",
    "- **Asynchronous IO**: a form of concurrency that utilizes tasks (aka routines) that are able to pause and allow other tasks to process while awaiting the result of other tasks \n",
    "- **CPU-bound**: tasks that are reliant on the processor working hard from start to finish\n",
    "- **`asyncio`**: a module added to the Python Standard Library in version 3.4 for implementing asynchronous coroutines in your code\n",
    "- **IO-bound**: tasks that are reliant on waiting for other input/output tasks to complete\n",
    "\n",
    "How does asynchronous IO fit into this again? It is not multiprocessing or threading, it is **cooperative multitasking**; a separate model of concurrency that utilizes a single thread and a single process.\n",

    "- **Coroutine**: a specialized version of a Python generator function that can suspend its execution before reaching return, and indirectly pass control to another coroutine for a time\n",
